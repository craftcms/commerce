# General Configuration

In addition to the settings available in Commerce → Settings, the config items below can be placed into a `commerce.php` file in your `craft/config/` folder. Use the same format as `config/general.php`. You may define it in one of the environment config arrays, depending on which environment(s) you want the setting to apply to.

For example, if you want to change the Commerce inactive carts duration in dev environments, but not on staging or production environments, do this:

```php{4,10}
return [
    // Global settings
    '*' => [
        // ...
    ],

    // Dev environment settings
    'dev' => [
        'purgeInactiveCartsDuration' => P1D,
        // ...
    ],

    // Staging environment settings
    'staging' => [
        // ...
    ],

    // Production environment settings
    'production' => [
        // ...
    ],
];
```

Here’s the full list of config settings that Commerce supports:

## `pdfAllowRemoteImages`

Determines if a Dompdf PDF render will allow remote images.

Default `false`

## `autoSetNewCartAddresses`

Determines whether the customer’s last used shipping and billing addresses should automatically be set on new carts.

Can be set to `true` or `false` (default is `true`).

How long the cookie storing the cart should last. The cart exists independently of the Craft user’s session.

## `gatewayPostRedirectTemplate`

Allows for the overriding of the template used to perform POST redirects to the payment gateway.

The template path that this item points to must contain a form that submits itself to the `actionUrl` variable, and outputs all hidden inputs with the `inputs` variable. Below is an example template:

```twig
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
    <title>Redirecting...</title>
</head>
<body onload="document.forms[0].submit();">
<form action="{{ actionUrl|raw }}" method="post">
    <p>Redirecting to payment page...</p>
    <p>
        {{ inputs|raw }}
        <input type="submit" value="Continue" />
    </p>
</form>
</body>
</html>
```

Since this template is simply used for redirecting, it only appears for a few seconds, so we suggest making it load fast with minimal images and inlined styles to reduce http requests.

## `mergeLastCartOnLogin`

Default: `true`

When a user logs into their Craft account all line items in previous cart are merged with the current cart.

## `pdfPaperSize`

Default: `letter`

The size of the paper to use for generated order PDF files (letter, legal, A4, etc.).  A full list of paper size values can be found [here](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/blob/master/src/Adapter/CPDF.php#L45).

## `pdfPaperOrientation`

Default: `portrait`

The orientation of the paper to use for generated order PDF files. Valid values are `portrait` or `landscape`.

## `purgeInactiveCarts`

Default: `true`

Should Commerce purge old inactive carts from the database. See the [`purgeInactiveCartsDuration`](#purgeInactiveCartsDuration) setting to control how old the cart needs to be.

## `purgeInactiveCartsDuration`

A php [Date Interval](http://php.net/manual/en/class.dateinterval.php)
Default: 3 months. (`P3M`).

Inactive carts older than this interval from their last update will be purged (deleted).

::: tip
The interval check for purging of inactive carts is only run when visiting the Orders index page in the Control Panel.
:::

## `requireBillingAddressAtCheckout`

Can be set to `true` or `false` (default is `false`).

## `requireShippingAddressAtCheckout`

Determines whether payment requests made to the `commerce/payments/pay` controller action requires a shipping address to be present on an order before attempting payment.

Can be set to `true` or `false` (default is `false`).

## `requireShippingMethodSelectionAtCheckout`
