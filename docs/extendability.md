# Extendability

Commerce is a flexible and extensible platform, and just like Craft we have provided hooks and
events to enable developers to add features to the system.

[Events Referenced](events-reference.md) — Listen for Craft Commerce events and run PHP code.

[Hooks Reference](hooks-reference.md) — Modify Craft Commerce behavior.

[Purchasables](purchasables.md) — Add an element to the system that is sellable.

[Adjusters](adjusters.md) — Make any price adjustment to an order.

[Shipping Methods](shipping-methods.md) — Add 3rd Party shipping methods and return shipping prices.
