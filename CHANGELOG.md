- Renamed `Commerce_ProductTypeService::save()` to `saveProductType()`.
- Renamed `Commerce_PurchasableService` to `Commerce_PurchasablesService` (plural).
- Renamed all `Commerce_OrderStatusService` methods to be more explicit (e.g. `save()` is now `saveOrderStatus()`).

- Added “TYPE_” and “STATUS_” prefixes to each of the constants on TransactionRecord, to clarify their purposes.
- Order models no longer have $billingAddressData and $shippingAddressData properties. The billing/shipping addresses chosen by the customer during checkout are now duplicated in the craft_commerce_addresses table upon order completion, and the order’s billingAddressId and shippingAddressId attributes are updated to the new address records’ IDs.
- Purchasables must now have a `getTaxCategoryId()` method, which returns the ID of the tax category that should be applied to the purchasable.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where variants were not being returned in the user-defined order on the front end.

- Fixed a bug where the line items’ `taxIncluded` amount was not getting reset to zero before recalculating the amount of included tax.
- Fixed a bug where products of a type that had been switched from having variants to not having variants could end up with an extra Title field on the Edit Product page.
- Fixed an issue where Craft Personal and Client installations where making user groups available to sale and discount conditions.
- Fixed a PHP error that occurred when an order model’s `userId` attribute was set to the ID of a user account that didn’t have a customer record associated with it.
- Fixed a bug where quantity restrictions on a product/variant were not being applied consistently to line items that were added with custom options.
- Fixed some language strings that were not getting static translations applied to them.
- Fixed a bug where Price fields were displaying blank values when they had previously been set to `0`.

## 0.9.1176 - 2015-11-17

### Added

- Added the “Automatic SKU Format” Product Type setting, which defines what products’/variants’ SKUs should look like when they’re submitted without a value.

- Order models now have a `totalDiscount` property, which returns the total of all discounts applied to its line items, in addition to the base discount.

### Changed
- The tax engine now records the amount of included tax for each line item, via a new `taxIncluded` property on line item models. (This does not affect existing tax calculation behaviors in any way.)

- The example templates have been updated to demonstrate the new Line Item Options feature.

## 0.9.1175 - 2015-11-11

### Added
- Added a new “Show the Title field for variants” setting to Product Types that have variants. When checked, variants of products of that Product Type will get a new “Title” field that can be directly edited by product managers.

### Changed
- Renamed `craft.commerce.getShippingMethods()` to `getAvailableShippingMethods()`.

## 0.9.1173 - 2015-11-09

- Added a `getCountriesByTaxZoneId()` method to the Tax Zones service.
- Added a `getStatesByTaxZoneId()` method to the Tax Zones service.
- It is now possible to create new Tax Zones and Tax Categories directly from the Edit Tax Rate page.

### Changed
- The ShippingMethod interface has three new methods: `getType()`, `getId()`, and `getCpEditUrl()`. (`getId()` should always return `null` for third party shipping methods.)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where the “Craft Commerce” link in the global sidebar would direct users to the front-end site, if the `cpTrigger` config setting was not set to `'admin'`.
- Updated the “Post Date” and “Expiry Date” table column headings on the Products index page, which were still labeled “Available On” and “Expires On”.

- Renamed the `craft.market` variable to `craft.commerce`.

(The only other `commerce/cart/*` actions that remain are `updateLineItem`, `removeLineItem`, and `removeAllLineItems`.)
- It is now possible to use token billing with some gateways, like Stripe, by passing a `token` POST param to the `cartPay/pay` controller action, so your customers’ credit card info never touches your server.
